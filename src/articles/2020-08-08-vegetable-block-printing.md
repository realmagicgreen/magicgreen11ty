## TLDR

Block printing technique is super fun and easy once you know the basics.

You can print fabric, paper or whatever, just pick the right type of ink.

Wood blocks are longer lasting so that can be printed again and again. But if you’re not creating a huge edition of prints, vegetable or fruit block is the way to go.
