## TLDR

Block printing technique is super fun and easy once you know the basics.

You can print fabric, paper or whatever, just pick the right type of ink.

Wood blocks are longer lasting so that can be printed again and again. But if you’re not creating a huge edition of prints, vegetable or fruit block is the way to go.

# What's block printing?

Block printing is the process of printing onto fabric or paper using a hand-cut block, usually made of wood.

{% assign img = "http://localhost:8080/assets/p/techniques/vegtest/vegetable-block-printing-03.jpg" %}{% image img, "zoom", "printing using an hand-cut block", "100vw" %}
</div>


After carving the block, applying ink, then printing begins. Hence, the name block printing.

Long time ago, block printing fabric was common, most often onto silk cloths.

It wasn’t until relatively recently that it was eventually adapted to paper.
