Did you know that nearly 4 billion trees are cut down each year for paper. Used paper towels are not recyclable.

1 ton of paper towels consumes 17 trees, pollutes 75.708.236 liters of water.

Solutions exist. For the simple household think washable fabric towels.

If you are running an hotel or a restaurant, think electric hand driers. Let's do our part to save the environment.
